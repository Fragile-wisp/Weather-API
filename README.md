# Weather-API
Aim:
Trying to build a flask app to learn about python and html. Trying to add a few other features to liven things up as well.

Features:
-Fetches weather from city and country input
-Error handling
-Rate limiting (limit on api requests)
-Redis caching (stores inputs for some time for efficiency)

Inspiration from:
